// String difference:
// ------------------
// Given 2 strings (without whitespace) as input, find the indices
// at which the strings have different characters, stopping at the
// end of the shorter one. For each such index, print a line con-
// taining the index as well as the character in each string. For
// example, if the strings are "dealer" and "dollars", the program
// should print:
// 1 e o
// 2 a l
// 4 e a
